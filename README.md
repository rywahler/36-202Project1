 Bike Sharing Predictions
This project takes raw data from a bike sharing company in conjunction with weather data for the relevant time period in the city of operation. The goal of this project is to deliver the company a method of prediction for the number of casual riders at any time given the weather, day of the week and time of the year. A casual rider is an individual whoâ€™s use of the service is seemingly unpredictable, opposed to an intensive user that may use the service every day of the week at 8:00 am for their commute to work. This method of prediction should allow the company to alleviate any shortages in their service that may come around when there is a high number of casual riders in addition to the intensive users. Univariate and bivariate exploration in the form of histograms, bar plots, scatter plots and box plots were used to give the readers comprehension of the data. Validation and modeling in the form of pairs plots, VIF, multilinear regression, QQ residuals, were used to draw conclusions.
